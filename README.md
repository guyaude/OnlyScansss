# OnlyScans 😌

OnlyScans is a **frontend-only image compression, enhancement, and optimization tool** built as a fun side project and product-thinking experiment.

Despite the playful name, the goal is serious:  
**make image optimization simple, private, and enjoyable.**

No backend.  
No database.  
No uploads.  
Everything runs **locally in your browser**.
